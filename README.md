# Bob Klaas - Binary Tree Challenge

### The Challenge
Your company needs you to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST), using the language of your choice. Your solution will be utilized by several different teams throughout your organization. Initially, this BST only needs to support integers.

### Requirements
- The BST must be built from an array of integers
- Implement a method that returns the deepest nodes in the BST along with their depth
- Implement any supporting methods needed for the solution to be useable by different teams throughout the organization

### Example:
**Input:** 12,11,90,82,7,9
**Output:** deepest, 9; depth, 3

### Solution
Solution Language: Javascript (Vanilla)  
Instructions: Run index.html in a web browser and use the UI to generate facts about your Binary Search Tree (BST).

### Methods:
You may call several custom methods on the Tree class.
- **addValue()**: Adds a value to the tree
- **getDeepest()**: Return the deepest node from the tree.
- **getMin()**: Return the node with the lowest value in the tree.
- **getMax()**: Return the node with the highest value in the tree.
- **search()**: Find a node by value and return it.
- **traverse()**: Return an array of values sorted using (Pre-Order, In-Order, or Post-Order Traversal)
